Exo is a passion project created by two brothers who love anime/manga. This project came into being when we decided that instead of having a bunch conversations about what we could do, we started drawing and concepting characters. 

This work is the culmination of hours of conversation between two people who are inspired everyday by the characters in anime and manga!

## Rough Story

Kai and Nawai, the two main characters, are struggling with taking care of their mother who is sick. Understanding the fatal state that their mother is in but not willing to accept it, Kai resolves to take the trial of Nomads â€“ a trial known for its dangerous nature but, if passed, gives the passer the honor of being a Nomad: explorers of the EXOs. Kai hopes that with this, he will be able to find the help his mother needs. Nawai, his older brother, more accepting of the prospect of their mother passing, still resolves to join his younger brother in the hopes of saving their mom. With this, they leave their home and begin their journey across the desert.

## Questions?

This story is still very, very, VERY early in production; however, we will keep working on it... especially since we don't leave home much.
